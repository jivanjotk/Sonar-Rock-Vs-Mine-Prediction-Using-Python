# Sonar-Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction-Using-Python
## Introduction - 
The SONAR technique has proven to be a valuable tool in detecting rocks and minerals, overcoming challenges that traditional methods might find difficult. Leveraging machine learning, particularly logistic regression, this project aims to predict whether a surface target is a rock or a mine based on SONAR data. The implementation is carried out using Google Colab.
## DataSet
The dataset, sourced from the UCI Repository, consists of 61 features that distinguish between rocks and mines, comprising a total of 209 samples. The dataset serves the purpose of training and testing the model. The last column in the dataset indicates whether it's a mine or a rock, a crucial factor for prediction.
## Model
The chosen model for this project is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that employs a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. By utilizing a sigmoid or logit function, logistic regression creates an "S"-shaped curve, mapping values to a range between 0 and 1. This makes it well-suited for binary classification, making predictions based on SONAR data.

## Description
The SONAR data, provided in a CSV file, undergoes preprocessing to prepare it for training and testing. Following preprocessing, a logistic regression model is constructed. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the training data used to train the model. Subsequently, the trained logistic regression model is applied to new data for predictions.
